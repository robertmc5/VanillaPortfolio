# Vanilla JavaScript Portfolio  
This is my web developer portfolio site as of the first week of April 2023.  
It conveys my current skills and where I'm at on my journey to being a developer.  
There are JavaScript projects showcased, links to my GitHub and a contact page.  
The contact page uses formsubmit.co to forward the email to me.  
  
There are five HTML and CSS files, some local images and a pdf.  
Currently this resides at   robertmccarter.tech
